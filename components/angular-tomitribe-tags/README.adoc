# angular-tomitribe-tags

A simple wrapper of `ui-select` allowing to maintain a TagReference array width
a predefined behavior.

## Dependencies

This components relies on `angular-ui-select` so don't forget to include it.

## Refreshing

If you need to refresh the tags without reloading the page you can trigger the event:

    tribe-tags:refresh

If this event is not enough or not granular enough you can use this one to add a single tag (don't forget to pass the tag as event parameter):

    tribe-tags:addtag
